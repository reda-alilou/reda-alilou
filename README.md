## Hey, I'm Reda 👋

2nd year Data Science & Engineering student at [INPT](https://www.inpt.ac.ma/), focused on building data pipelines and making sense of messy data.

### What I'm working with

Currently building stuff with Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL. Did a summer internship where I got to work on ETL pipelines and automated data workflows, which was pretty cool.

**Main tools:** Python • SQL • Pandas • PostgreSQL • Docker • Git  
**Learning:** Kafka, Spark, Azure (trying to get better at real-time data processing)

### Projects I've worked on

Most of my repos here are from school projects and personal experiments:
- Built an end-to-end ML system with FastAPI deployment
- Created some NLP classification pipelines
- Currently messing around with real-time data streaming

When I'm not coding, I'm probably gaming or listening to music.
